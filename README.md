# Football_Scores-master
Football Scores is a soccer score app for the Udacity Nanodegree (Project 3). 
The objective of the project was to enhance a pre-existing code base. While the pre-existing code wasn't very clean, my objective was to make the app RTL and a11y compliant, while also creating a collection widget.
